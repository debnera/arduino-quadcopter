FlightController
================
1. General
----------
This is a quadcopter flightcontroller program for an Arduino-based
quadcopter. This is still work in progress, so there might be bugs
that can lead to a crash.

2. Command interface
--------------------
This program is designed to be controlled by a set of commands, preferably
by a pc or a smartphone instead of a regular RC-controller.

NOTE:
      Some of the commands are ASCII special characters, and some are plain text.
      '%' Means a float value, with decimals separated by '.' or ','.
      '#' Means an integer value.

Commands from quadcopter:
-ENQ = (PING) The copter sends this character to check if the connection is OK. The
      controller should respond with ACK. If no commands (ACK or anything else)
      is received for a certain time, the quadcopter will stop all motors.

Commands to quadcopter:
-ACK = (OK) Indicates that the connection between quadcopter and its controller is OK.
-DC1 = (Start) Activates all motors.
-DC4 = (Stop) Disables all motors.
-'y%p%r%' = (Angles) Changes yaw, pitch and roll according to the float values.
-'t#' = (Throttle) Changes throttle to the given integer.
-'r' = (Reset yaw) Resets yaw axis to zero.
-'p' = (Roll/Pitch p) Changes the p value of roll/pitch PID controller.
-'i' = (Roll/Pitch i) Changes the i value of roll/pitch PID controller.
-'w' = (Yaw p) Changes the p value of yaw PID controller.
-'m#' = (Control mode) Changes the controlling mode.
        0: Angle control: Copter attempts to mantain its orientation. (According to angles)  
        1: Rate control: Copter attempts to mantain angular rates. (According to angles)  
        2: Raw control: The values of angles are directly added to motor powers without any PID interference.
